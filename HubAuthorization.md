# Introduction #

Logins and passwords shouldn't be shared across clients applications and alike. OAuth offers this functionality. User logins / passwords are substituted on authorization of the User (Owner) by application specific credidentials. This specific credidentials could be used to limit access to certain resources and methods (a HUB should not be allowed to change USER password for example).
